When the game starts, the prize will be dropped to a certain point, and whoever gets to it first will get the prize.</p><p>Alice decided that she would start running from point $$$a$$$. Bob, however, has not yet chosen his starting position.</p><p>Bob knows that the prize could drop either at point $$$x$$$ or at point $$$y$$$. He also knows that he can reach the prize faster than Alice if the distance from his starting position to the prize is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">strictly less</span> than the distance from Alice's starting position to the prize. The distance between any two points $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ is calculated as $$$|c-d|$$$.</p><p>Your task is to determine whether Bob can choose an integer point that is guarantee to get to the prize faster, regardless of where it appears (at point $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$). Bob can choose any integer point, except for $$$a$$$ (in particular, he can choose to start in point $$$x$$$, point $$$y$$$, or any other point, but not $$$a$$$).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le a, x, y \le 100$$$).

If the prize will be at point $$$x$$$, then Bob's distance is $$$|4-3|=1$$$ and Alice's distance is $$$|1-3|=2$$$.
